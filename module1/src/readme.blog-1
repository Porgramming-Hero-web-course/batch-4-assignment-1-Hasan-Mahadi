Answer:

# Union and intersection types both are very important in TypeScript, because they help to combine different types of values ​​and structures...


# Union Type: It allows users to accept any one of the multiple types. For example, string | number union type can be either string or number.


# Intersection Type: It combines multiple types to form a new type, which contains all the properties of the type. For example,  type (A & B) intersection will contain the properties of type A and type B together.
